        <h1>Blockchain</h1>
        
        <p> By allowing digital information to be distributed but not copied, blockchain technology created the backbone of a new type of internet.           
           The value of the Blockchain technology comes from the distributed security of the system. For this reason, there are several characteristics that are completely necessary for developing or using a Blockchain.

We describe the 5 key concepts that are the basis of the Blockchain technology as we know it up to the date, based on the SuperDataScience course for Blockchain:
<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Cryptographic Hash</li>
            <li>Immutable Ledger</li>
            <li>P2P Network</li>
            <li>Consensus Protocol</li>
            <li>Block Validation or ‘Mining’  </li>
          </ul>

        <h1>Autonomonous Things</h1>
        
        <p> The emergence of autonomous things marks a key landmark in technological progress. Early examples include autonomous drones and self-driving vehicles. Expect to see more autonomous things as these kinds of technologies develop further.
Autonomous things are fundamentally important because they represent the first real untethering of machines from explicit human guidance. Humans are used to programming things, but are not used to them acting in autonomous ways. Self-driving vehicles are still making their way onto the roads. While widespread adoption of autonomous things has yet to occur, there are indications that it is coming soon.

        <h1>Immersive Experience </h1>
        
        <p>This technology superimposes a CG image on a user’s view of the real world. 
Unlike virtual reality, where everything a user sees is generated by a computer, 
augmented reality keeps the real-world focus, 
but just adds elements that aren’t really there to enhance the user’s experience.

Best Current Examples of Augmented Reality

The potential of augmented reality is endless.

It’s only a matter of time before this technology becomes a part of our everyday lives. 
We’re not quite there yet, 
but a few companies and organizations are making great strides with this technology today.
<br>
The United States Army is experimenting with augmented reality programs to be used in combat that would help soldiers distinguish between enemies and friendly troops, 
as well as improve night vision.
This technology is still in development and may be years away from deployment, 
but military officials say this innovation would improve combat efficiency and help save lives.
